This project was developed to showcase my skills in UX design and front-end development, focusing on creating intuitive, accessible, and visually clean digital experiences.

The UX process involved understanding user needs, structuring information clearly, and designing interfaces that are easy to navigate. On the front-end side, the project was built with attention to clean code, responsive layouts, and performance best practices.

This repository represents my approach to combining user-centered design with functional and scalable front-end solutions, from initial concept and wireframes to final implementation. It is part of my portfolio and reflects my continuous learning and growth in UX and front-end development.
